#
# SSDP is the mulsticast discovery protocol used by the
# Buffalo Networked DVD Player, and hopefully something
# similar by the others. In theory you should
# not need to change anything here if you want to use it.
#
# Specify UPNP if you also wish llink to respond to UPNP queries.
#
# Example line with all options is:
# SSDP|ON|multicast=239.255.255.250|port=1900|bindif=0|UPNP
#
# The reverse IP in bindif bug has been fixed.
#
# The default is:
#SSDP|ON|UPNP
SSDP|OFF|



#
# When we receive SSDP broadcast, and there might be a lot
# on your network, select the "match" filter by which we
# will recognise our DVD Player. In theory this should work
# for all MyiBox devices. If your report something different
# please email me for updates.
#
# Example line with all options is:
# USN|match=*myiBoxUPnP*SyabasSTB*|pattern=192.168.*:*
#
# The default is:
USN|match=*myiBoxUPnP*SyabasSTB*|pattern=*


# Advanced:
# Manually connect and declare ourselves? This should not be needed but
# for some situations it could be useful.
# For llink running on nmt, it ignores SSDP from own IP, so we alias a new
# IP, and force announcement to port 2020.

#
# The HTTP request port. This is where the DVD player will connect
# for the directory listings, as well as the files.
# By default, Buffalo's own software uses port 8000, so I use
# port 8001 so that both can run at the same time.
# The "name" field is what is displayed on the DVDPlayer.
# "pin" is only used for "parental" extra authority. All Directories and
# files starting with a "." are normally not shown. If a PIN is entered
# correctly, these are added to the listing. They are actually text strings.
#
# NOTE: user and pass is NOT yet implemented! Use bindif to
# bind to internal only nic. Patterns are also to come. See bindif note above
#
# UPnP (xboxb/ps3 etc) you need to specify your IP in bindif= for it to work. You also
# need llink.xml inside the skin's folder. For example, skin/aquarius_720/llink.xml
#
# Example line with all options is:
#HTTP|port=8001|bindif=0|pin=1234|name=llink-daemon|user=Syabasi|pass=myIBox
#
# The default is:
HTTP|port=8009|pin=1234|name=llink-plonk

#
# The SKIN used for all directory listings. Not that there are many.
# It will send "head.html", followed by the "TYPE" files below, and
# finally "tail.html". If you do something neat, please send it to me.
#
# SIZE_TYPE=human|bytes|none
#
# When replacing LLINK_FILE_SIZE, should it use human (5GB, 350MB) or
# bytes (1234576) or none (space). Note if you want to have details in
# the skin, use LLINK_DETAIL_SIZE which is always "bytes".
#
# PAGE_SIZE sets the number of lines a listing should send, by default.
# You can not set it if you want everything in one long list. Note that
# clients can always request from/to, which over-rides this value.
#
# PASSES specifies how many times should it loop over a directory listing,
# usually 1 is sufficient, but if you are doing fancy things... it tags on
# PASS number infront of the file names. Ie, head.html->2head.html,
# line_dir.html->2line_dir.html. First pass is still head.html. (not 1head.html).

# TYPE
#
# Define types of movies. This is to match a filename, to a
# HTML template file. So that "*.mpg" files, use "lines_movies.html"
# when producing HTML for the DVD Player.
# NOTE: This is "in ORDER". The first/top match here is used. End this
# list with "ext=*" and "name=unknown", or, blank if you wish not
# to display unknown types.
#
# See also the "mime.types" file, although my DVDPlayer seems to ignore
# "Content-Type:" tag.

# Example line with all options is:

# Separators. If you require extra HTML every 5th directory listing, as
# and example, we do this with special TYPE entry. This need to be before any

#
# Default line is:

#
# The list flags are:
#
#  -t  Sort list in date order
#  -N  Sort list in name order
#  -r  Reverse sorting order
#  -D  Sort directories before files. (Like Windows)
#  -s  Sort list in size order
#  -C  Case insensitive sorting. (Like Windows)
#  -a  Show dot-files
#  -W  Show directory content size instead of block count (expensive)
#  -G  If found ".genre" file, display this instead of group field.

# VISITED MEDIA DB
#
# Define this if you want llink to attempt to display media that it thinks
# has already been watched. It is stored in a DB file.
# MINTIME=sec : Minimum time a media file needs to have played to be considered

# USER SCRIPTS
#
# For the advanced users, you can define scripts to execute when the CGI part
# of the URI asks for it, with the first argument as the item selected.
# For example, something like:
# <a href=<!--LLINK_CURRENT_DIRECTORY_URL-->/&myscript=<!--LLINK_FILE_URL-->
#
# If the script sends output starting with "STATUS: " the STATUS_MESSAGE
# is updated in llink.
#
# If you set PIN=yes the script can only be executed after valid PIN input.
#
# Do remember to make the script executable (chmod 755 myscript.sh on Unix)

# Your root device(s). I allow you to specify the root as you want it
# and as many roots as you would like.
#
# NOTE: If you define mutiple roots, and those top level directories
# have the same named file and/or directory, you will only be able to
# access the first defined one. Please rename the clashes, or, put them
# into a sub-directory. (Or don't use multiple roots)
#
# You can also use the "SUBDIR" tag to alias a ROOT to a different name.
#
# FLAGS type is no longer used. See the SORT option above.
#
# Example line with all options is:
#ROOT|path=/tmp/

#ROOT|path=z:/
ROOT|path=/opt/sybhttpd/localhost.drives/

# with SUBDIR to give it a name.

#

# Unix derivatives can use ~username to expand to home directories.

# If you use ZFS, you can auto-export any filesystem with a certain attribute set.

#
# HTTP file system, current limitation is that there has to be one
